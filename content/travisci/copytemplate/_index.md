Use the GitHub import tool to create a copy of the template repository:

1. Copy the clone url for the template repo: https://github.com/weecology/livedat.git
2. Go to https://github.com/new/import
3. Paste the url for the template repo into the "Your old repositoryâ€™s clone
   URL" box on the import page
4. Choose a name for your new repository
5. Click "Begin import"

6. After the import is finished (typically a few minutes) navigate to your copy
   of the repository
7. If you want to work with it on your local machine, you can clone the repository as you would any other.
