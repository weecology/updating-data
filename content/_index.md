# Updating Data Recipe

This site is designed to walk you through the process of setting up an automated workflow for checking and processing regularly updating data using R, git, GitHub, Zenodo, and either Travis CI or GitHub Actions. It provides:

1. A template repository with the core R code for automation
2. Step by step instructions with screenshots for linking setting things up using either GitHub Actions or Travis CI and fully automating your data pipeline

This assumes a basic knowledge of git and a GitHub account.

Select either [GitHub Actions](githubactions) or [Travis CI](travisci) to get started and then either follow the navigation on the left or click the arrow on the right to get started!
