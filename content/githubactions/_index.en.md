# Updating Data With GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is GitHub's built in system that can be used for automating data pipelines. 
It used to be free for open source projects but now requires payment or applying for open source credits. This tutorial will walk you through setting up an automated data workflow using GitHub Actions + R, git, GitHub, and Zenodo. It assumes a basic knowledge of git and a GitHub account. Either follow the navigation on the left or click the arrow on the right to get started!
