Since the continuous integration done by GitHub Actions occurs in the repo itself, you don't need to create a "Personal Access Token" (PAT) that works like a password for you GitHub account. This is unlike the case with [Travis CI]() where a PAT is needed to connect Travis CI with your GitHub repo. 

In other words, nothing to do here!
